Website-JS-JQuery


You can see the project working here: https://purring-actor.surge.sh/index.html


This website has been created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and JQuery UI. 

You can: 

- See different pictures with the Slider
- Change the theme
- Log in and out
- Validate a form 
- Read information stored in accordions
- Watch a clock that shows the current time and adapts to the time-zone. 


The HTML will be optimised in due time, in order to not be repeated that much but right now I focused more on showing skills , practising and keep learning, as I love to do.
